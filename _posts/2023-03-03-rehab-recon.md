# Spinning the wheel back to real estate 🏡 

## Introduction
My top goal for 2023 is to purchase an income product if property that cash flows >= 10%. I have been using a formula almost verbatim from group called the multifamily movement #mfm . The property evaluation videos depict a bit of the process. 

## What’s new
I’ve been working on a process to get a realistic estimate for a full gut rehab or renovations that change the floor plans. Spent quite a bit of time drawing out the existing floor plan and the desired one this week. 

I plan on sharing it with the contractors  shortly. The scenario is based on a deal that passed the purchase or pass deal analyzer.  I likely won’t go forward with after seeing how much work would be needed to get to up to standard. However I want to know how much an extensive project like that will cost. This will help my expand the deals I can make by including full gut rehabs into my wheelhouse.
