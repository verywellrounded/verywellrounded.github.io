# 58 videos in 59 days

## Congrats you've got a loooong way to go

It’s a long way off from the initial goal of *“Share work one of my passions with the world everyday for 90-100% (328-365) days of the year”*. However, I think it’s a good point to reflect, inspect, and refine the goal. 

## Value vs Volume
Over the last 2 months there are a few themes I’ve noticed as well as feedback I’ve received. They all point to slowing down! Decreasing the **volume** of production while increasing the **value** proposition of the content — is the new challenge. 

Striking the right balance between sticking to a production schedule and doing purposeful work is hard! 


>My action item for this month is to come up with a production schedule that will allow me to provide the most valuable content in the passion disciplines. 

## Conclusion

In the meantime there will be a pause on the daily release of content. I will do my best to let the blogs stand in their place until resuming video production. 

Thanks for following the journey! I’m excited to see where we end up 😬

    P.S if you came here from youtube its 58 videos and 1 short in 59 days 😉
