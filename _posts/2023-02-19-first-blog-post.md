# Welcome to the blog version of verywellrounded 👋🏾

## Introduction
This form of accountability through consistently sharing work in endeavours of passion will hopefully:
1) Inspire
2) Document the journeys of passion projects to products in production
3) Garner support and collaboration taking the passion further than I alone could ever do

## Background
The [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKkDMyVvzcN1ywwctSp_hpw) is where the first set of accountability has been tracked. Churning out youtube video's every day isn't as feasible. I'm creating this blog in order to limit the barrier to sticking to the following goal: 

    Share work one of my passions with the world everyday for 90-100% (328-365) days of the year


## Format 
I will be tinkering with the format for the blog to make it: 
1. Digestable, informative, and inspirational
2. Prioritize progress over perfection


## Conclusion 
Hope to look back on this rough first blog post and the continuation of something magical. 🙏🏾
